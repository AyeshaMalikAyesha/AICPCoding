# AICPCoding
This repository contains my solutions to the weekly challenges presented by the AICP (Artificial Intelligence Community Pakistan) challenge. Each week, I'll be tackling new problems and challenges, demonstrating my problem-solving skills, coding expertise, and understanding of algorithms and data structures.

# Structure of the Repository
Every weekly challenge will have its own dedicated directory labeled with the week number (e.g., Week 1, Week 2).
Inside each directory, you'll find the problem statement, my solution code, and any relevant input-output examples or test cases.
The main README (this document) will be updated with summaries of each week's challenge and links to the respective directories.

# Goals of Participating in the AICP Challenge:
Skill Development: To enhance and test my coding and algorithmic skills.
Collaboration: Engage with the AICP community and learn from peers.
Continuous Learning: Stay updated with latest challenges and AI trends through regular participation.
Contribution: Give back to the community by sharing my solutions and approaches, and learning from feedback.

# Weekly Challenges:
